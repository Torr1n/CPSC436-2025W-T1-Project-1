Spec Clinic Quick Check (Formative)
Purpose. Early guardrail to keep your Project 1 design on track. We check three things: no leakage, SLA defined, and baseline present. This is formative (low/no points) and fast to review.

What to submit (pick one)
A 1–2 page draft (or the first 1–2 sections of the Spec Template) covering: user & decision, target & horizon (what/when), features (no leakage), baseline plan, metric & SLA (p95 latency, cost envelope), and a minimal evaluation plan (offline OK).
Or a filled Spec Template outline with those sections highlighted.
Design‑only. No code is required. Prototypes are optional and not graded.
Expand acronyms on first use or see the Glossary.
What we check (rubric)
No Leakage: Features are available at prediction time; explicitly exclude leakage (e.g., future info, PII).
SLA Defined: p95 latency + cost envelope stated (e.g., p95 < 100 ms; free‑tier minded at normal load).
Baseline Present: A defensible rule/heuristic you can evaluate (the model is optional at this stage).
How we give feedback
Rubric marks Yes/No for each criterion.
If “No”, we add a one‑sentence nudge (e.g., “Define p95 latency target and measurement plan”).
You can adjust and resubmit before the final Project 1 deadline.
Do / Don’t
Do: Use the Spec Template; keep it short and specific.
Do: Expand acronyms on first use (PIA, SLA, TTL, AUC‑PR, MAE) or link to the Glossary.
Don’t: Submit code; Project 1 is design‑only.
