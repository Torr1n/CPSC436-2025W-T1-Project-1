Architecture Diagram Starter (Project 1)
Use this as a starting point for your one‑page architecture diagram. Keep it simple and label where privacy guardrails apply.

What to include
Boxes: Client, API Gateway/Ingress, Compute, Data Store, Observability
Arrows: request flow; where features are computed; where guardrails apply
Labels: retention TTLs, k‑anonymity/jitter (if public outputs), SLA target
Keep to one page (6–8 boxes)
Exclude low‑level implementation details
Note your target & horizon somewhere on the diagram
Optional: add a small “Risks & Tests” box with your acceptance checks
Pair this with a minimal evaluation plan (baseline vs simple model, metric, SLA measurement, cost envelope)
