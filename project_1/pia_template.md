## 1. Overview

- Project name, purpose, and scope.
- Data processing summary (collection → processing → sharing → retention).

## 2. Data Inventory

- Fields collected (raw and derived).
- For each field: purpose, lawful basis (if applicable), minimization, retention, access roles.

## 3. Linkability & Identifiability

- Can events be linked across sessions/users? How? (e.g., referrer+time+token)
- Quasi-identifiers present (IP, UA, location) and re-identification risks.

## 4. Purpose Limitation & Secondary Use

- Declared purposes. Process to approve new purposes.
- Protections against function creep.

## 5. Minimization & Retention

- Aggregation/sampling strategies; bucketing/truncation; hashing/anonymization.
- Raw TTL (days); aggregate retention; secure deletion plan.

## 6. Access Control & Governance

- Roles and least-privilege policies. Auditability of access.
- Third parties involved (if any) and contracts.

- Secrets management and transport security.

## 9. Compliance & Policy Alignment
