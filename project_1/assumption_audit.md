# Assumption Audit (Checklist)

---

**Purpose**: make your assumptions explicit, test them, and record how results change.

## Project / Sprint

- **Project**:
- **Sprint window**:

## Assumptions (add rows)

| Assumption                                  | Why it might fail                     | Test you ran                                  | Result                  | Impact on conclusions                |
| :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------- | :---------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **Example:**<br>Immigration proxy = permits | Under/over-counts;<br>lagged behavior | Spec A vs A+lag;<br>compare against alt proxy | Coeff â†“<br>30% with lag | We weaken claim;<br>note uncertainty |
|                                             |                                       |                                               |                         |                                      |

## Sensitivity / Spec Grid

- Briefly summarize which specs you ran and how estimates moved. Link to plots/spec-curve.

## Actions Taken

- Kept/changed/dropped assumptions and why.

> If you can't test an assumption now, note it and propose a feasible future test.
