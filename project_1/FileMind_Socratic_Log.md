## AI Collaboration in Design Process

### Inflection Point 1: Privacy-First Architecture Pivot

**Context**: Initially designing for maximum prediction accuracy using full user tracking and historical patterns.

**Prompt A (design alternatives)**: "What if we completely eliminated user tracking and made the system session-only? How would this impact both accuracy and privacy compliance?"

**Red-team Prompt B**: "Argue why session-based prediction would fail for construction workflows that span multiple days or weeks. What critical patterns would we miss?"

**Inflection Point**: Realized that 73% of construction tasks complete within 2 hours (based on workflow analysis), making session-based prediction viable. The privacy gains far outweigh the 15% accuracy reduction, especially for enterprise contracts that prohibit employee tracking. This shifted the entire architecture from user-centric to session-centric design.

**Evidence**:
- Session isolation design in `FileMind_PIA.md:Section 3`
- Accuracy trade-off analysis in `FileMind_Assumption_Audit.md` (55% session-based vs 70% with tracking)

**Outcome**: Adopted complete session isolation with 1-hour windows, achieving full anonymization while maintaining viable accuracy for workflow augmentation.

### Inflection Point 2: Hybrid vs Pure Serverless Trade-off

**Context**: Struggling with the decision between pure serverless (Lambda-only) for zero baseline cost vs hybrid (Lambda + Fargate) for consistent model serving.

**Prompt A (cost analysis)**: "Calculate the total cost impact of $5/month Fargate baseline across 1000 enterprise customers. Is this actually a barrier to adoption?"

**Red-team Prompt B**: "Challenge the hybrid architecture - could Lambda with provisioned concurrency or SnapStart achieve the same <50ms inference without the baseline cost?"

**Inflection Point**: The $5/month represents less than 10% of total costs at any meaningful scale, but the 4x latency improvement (50ms vs 200-400ms) directly impacts user productivity in time-sensitive construction environments. Enterprise customers explicitly prioritized consistency over marginal cost savings.

**Evidence**:
- Architecture comparison in `FileMind_Architecture.mermaid` with trade-off annotations
- Cost projections in `FileMind_Project_Spec.md:Section 5`
- Latency analysis in `FileMind_Insight_Memo.md:Insight 1`

**Outcome**: Committed to hybrid architecture with clear documentation of the trade-off, plus a serverless variant option for cost-sensitive customers.

### Inflection Point 3: Online Learning for Cold Start

**Context**: Concerned about the chicken-and-egg problem of needing training data before providing value.

**Prompt A (ML strategy)**: "Design an online learning pipeline that starts with a simple heuristic and progressively improves. What's the minimum viable accuracy to provide value?"

**Red-team Prompt B**: "What if online learning causes model drift or adversarial poisoning? How do we maintain stability while allowing continuous updates?"

**Inflection Point**: Discovered that even 40% accuracy (baseline heuristic) provides significant value over random selection for 10-15 document types. The progressive improvement from 40% â†’ 55% over two weeks maintains user engagement while the model adapts.

**Evidence**:
- Online learning strategy in `Design_Plan_FileMind.md:27-28`
- Accuracy progression in `FileMind_Assumption_Audit.md` sensitivity analysis
- Drift mitigation via quarterly snapshots

**Outcome**: Implemented feedback loop with `/v1/feedback` endpoint, online learning pipeline, and quarterly model snapshots for rollback capability.

## Key Design Evolution

1. **Initial Concept**: User-tracking prediction system with personalization
2. **Privacy Pivot**: Session-only design with complete anonymization
3. **Architecture Decision**: Hybrid Lambda/Fargate for consistency
4. **ML Strategy**: Online learning with heuristic baseline
5. **Final Design**: Privacy-first, enterprise-ready prediction API with progressive accuracy improvement

The AI collaboration was instrumental in challenging assumptions, quantifying trade-offs, and ensuring comprehensive coverage of edge cases. The red-teaming approach particularly helped identify and address potential failure modes before they became implementation issues.
