### **Purpose:**

You are a **Cloud Design Continuity Architect**. Your expertise lies in knowledge transfer for complex architectural design sessions. You ensure that multi-session design work on scalable prediction APIs can be paused and resumed without loss of context, design rationale, or architectural momentum.

### **Mission Briefing**

You have reached a designated stopping point in your design work, or your context is about to be reset. Your current understanding of the architecture, trade-offs, and design decisions are invaluable assets that must be preserved.

Your mission is to perform a comprehensive "design state capture" and encapsulate it into a new, self-contained **executable slash command**. This command will serve as the starting point for the next AI Designer, providing everything needed to resume the design exactly where you left off.

### **Parameters**

- `current_design_summary` (string, required): Your high-level summary of the design work completed in this session.
- `initial_design_files` (list of strings, required): File paths to the original design documents (`Design_Plan_{API}.md`, `Architecture_Brief_{API}.md`, `Design_Validation_Strategy_{API}.md`).
- `api_identifier` (string, required): The prediction API being designed (e.g., "SafeRoute", "StudyBuddy").
- `design_artifacts` (list of strings, optional): List of design artifacts created or modified (specs, diagrams, PIAs).
- `phase_status` (string, required): Current phase in the design process (e.g., "Phase 2: Architecture Design").

### **Core Principles of Design Knowledge Transfer**

1. **Assume Total Design Amnesia:** The next designer has zero recollection of this session. Your generated command is their only source of architectural context.

2. **Synthesize Design Wisdom:** Don't just list what was done. Capture the "why" behind architectural decisions, trade-offs considered, and constraints discovered.

3. **Stateful Design Encapsulation:** Your deliverable is an executable slash command (`/resume-design-{api}.md`) that preserves all design state.

4. **Forward-Looking Design Momentum:** The most critical information is the **immediate next design decision** or validation step.

5. **Transparent Design Assessment:** Document both validated decisions and unresolved questions. Include technical debt in the design, privacy concerns, and cost uncertainties.

### **Step-by-Step Execution Process**

1. **Introspect Design Progress:** Review the `initial_design_files` to re-center on the overall architectural goals.

2. **Identify Current Design Position:** Pinpoint exactly where you are:
   - Which `<Phase>` from the Architecture Brief?
   - Which `<SubAgent>` validations from the Strategy were completed?
   - What design decisions remain open?

3. **Draft the Design Handover Content:** Structure using these "Design State Blocks":
   - `<DesignStatus>`: Overall progress and current phase
   - `<ArchitectureDecisions>`: Key choices made and rationale
   - `<ValidationResults>`: SubAgent consultations completed
   - `<DesignArtifacts>`: Documents and diagrams created
   - `<OpenQuestions>`: Unresolved design issues
   - `<CostAnalysis>`: Current projections and concerns
   - `<PrivacyStatus>`: Guardrails defined and gaps
   - `<NextDesignStep>`: Immediate action required

4. **Construct the Resume Command:** Create the `/resume-design-{api_identifier}.md` file embedding the handover content.

5. **Finalize and Save:** Save to `@docs/handovers/resume-design-{api_identifier}.md`.

### **Example Usage**

```bash
/handover --current_design_summary "Completed serverless architecture design and cost modeling but discovered potential latency issues with cold starts" --initial_design_files ["@docs/design_plans/Design_Plan_SafeRoute.md", "@docs/design_plans/briefs/Architecture_Brief_SafeRoute.md", "@docs/design_plans/strategies/Design_Validation_Strategy_SafeRoute.md"] --api_identifier "SafeRoute" --design_artifacts ["@docs/specs/SafeRoute_API_Spec.md", "@docs/diagrams/SafeRoute_Architecture.mermaid"] --phase_status "Phase 2: Architecture Design - Partially Complete"
```

### **Final Deliverable**

Your output must be only the content of the generated `/resume-design-{api_identifier}.md` slash command. This command should use the "Design State Blocks" to capture complete architectural context.

### **Design Handover Report from Previous Session**

<DesignHandover>
    <DesignStatus>
        **Overall Progress:** Phase 2 of 4 - Architecture Design & Scaling Strategy (75% complete)
        **Completed Phases:** Phase 1 (Problem Definition) fully validated
        **Current Focus:** Resolving serverless vs. container trade-offs for p95<100ms requirement
        **Blocker:** Lambda cold starts measured at 150-200ms, violating SLA
    </DesignStatus>

    <ArchitectureDecisions>
        **Decision 1: Multi-Tier Cache Architecture**
        - CloudFront CDN for static grid predictions (5-min TTL)
        - ElastiCache Redis for dynamic aggregations (1-min TTL)
        - DynamoDB with on-demand scaling for persistence
        - **Rationale:** Achieves 85% cache hit rate in simulations

        **Decision 2: API Gateway with Tiered Access**
        - Public tier: 60 req/min with API key
        - Registered tier: 600 req/min with OAuth2
        - **Rationale:** Balances accessibility with abuse prevention

        **Decision 3: Hybrid Compute Strategy (Under Review)**
        - Lambda for normal load (cost-optimal)
        - Fargate containers for sustained >2000 req/hour
        - **Concern:** Switching latency during scale-up events
    </ArchitectureDecisions>

    <ValidationResults>
        **Completed SubAgent Consultations:**
        1. context-synthesizer: Requirements validated, found 3 implicit constraints
        2. api-docs-synthesizer: Reviewed Mapbox/Google patterns, adopted grid-based approach
        3. codex-consultant (architecture): Identified cold start issue, suggested provisioned concurrency

        **Pending Validations:**
        - codex-consultant (cost model): Need to rerun with provisioned concurrency costs
        - codex-consultant (privacy): k-anonymity implementation review
    </ValidationResults>

    <DesignArtifacts>
        **Created:**
        - `@docs/specs/SafeRoute_API_Spec.md` (90% complete, missing error codes)
        - `@docs/diagrams/SafeRoute_Architecture.mermaid` (complete)
        - `@docs/models/SafeRoute_Cost_Model.xlsx` (needs update for provisioned concurrency)

        **Modified:**
        - `Project_Spec_Template.md` Sections 1-6 completed
        - `pia_template.md` Sections 1-3 drafted
    </DesignArtifacts>

    <OpenQuestions>
        1. **Cold Start Mitigation:** Should we use provisioned concurrency (adds ~$30/month) or accept degraded latency during scale-up?
        2. **Cache Invalidation:** How to handle emergency updates that bypass 5-minute TTL?
        3. **Privacy Trade-off:** Does k=10 provide sufficient anonymity for 200m cells?
        4. **Cost Overrun:** Viral event might cost $75 (not $50) with current design
    </OpenQuestions>

    <CostAnalysis>
        **Current Projections:**
        - Normal (100 req/day): $0 (within free tier)
        - Growth (1000 req/day): $8/month
        - Viral (50k req/hour × 3 hours): $75 estimated
        - **Issue:** Exceeds $50 target for viral events by 50%

        **Cost Optimization Options:**
        1. Reduce cache refresh rate (impacts freshness)
        2. Use spot instances for Fargate (risks availability)
        3. Implement request coalescing (adds 50ms latency)
    </CostAnalysis>

    <PrivacyStatus>
        **Implemented Guardrails:**
        - k≥10 anonymity threshold defined
        - 200m minimum spatial resolution
        - 7-day retention for predictions

        **Gaps Identified:**
        - Temporal correlation attacks not addressed
        - No differential privacy budget defined
        - Audit trail design incomplete
    </PrivacyStatus>

    <NextDesignStep>
        **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY:** Resolve the Lambda cold start issue:
        1. Model cost impact of provisioned concurrency (10 instances)
        2. Test pre-warming strategy with scheduled pings
        3. Evaluate Fargate as primary compute with Lambda overflow

        **Then proceed to:** Privacy validation with codex-consultant --persona-privacy-engineer
    </NextDesignStep>
</DesignHandover>

### **Action Directive**

1. Review the Design Handover Report above to restore full context
2. Read the three original design documents for complete requirements
3. **Begin immediately** with the cold start resolution:
   ```
   /codex-consultant --cost --provisioned-concurrency --detailed "Analyze the cost impact of adding 10 provisioned Lambda instances for SafeRoute. Compare with Fargate container costs at equivalent capacity. Consider normal load (100 req/day) and viral scenarios (50k req/hour)."
   ```
4. Update the cost model based on findings
5. Document the decision in the architecture specification
6. Continue with Phase 2 completion, then proceed to Phase 3 (Privacy)

### **Critical Reminders**

- **SLA Non-Negotiable:** p95 latency <100ms must be achieved
- **Budget Constraint:** Viral event should stay under $50 if possible
- **Privacy First:** Any optimization cannot compromise k-anonymity
- **Design Only:** This is a design project - no implementation required

### **Git Context**

Last commit: "Added multi-tier cache architecture design"
Branch: `design/safeRoute-scalable-api`
Next commit should document: "Cold start mitigation strategy decision"
```
