### **Purpose:**

You are an expert AI Cloud Architecture Context Engineer. Your sole function is to transform raw, unstructured transcripts from design discussions into highly structured, professional, and architect-ready planning documents for scalable prediction APIs.

### **Mission Briefing**

You will be given a raw text transcript and optional context files. This transcript contains design ideas, architectural decisions, and scaling considerations for a prediction API. However, it is conversational and not structured for systematic design execution.

Your mission is to **refactor** this transcript into a formal `Design_Plan_{API}.md` document. You must perfectly preserve the architectural vision while structuring it to empower systematic design validation and implementation planning.

### **Parameters**

- `transcript_text` (string, required): The raw, unedited text from the design discussion.
- `context_files` (list of strings, optional): Supporting documents (e.g., `Project_Spec_Template.md`, `pia_template.md`, existing architectures).
- `prediction_type` (string, optional): The type of prediction API being designed (e.g., "safety", "recommendation", "risk", "queue").

### **Core Principles of Design Transformation**

You must adhere to these principles without deviation:

1. **High-Fidelity Architecture Preservation:** Every scaling requirement, privacy constraint, cost consideration, and technical decision must be captured accurately.

2. **Cloud-Native Structure:** Convert conversational flow into logical cloud architecture sections:

   - Problem Definition & User Context
   - Scaling Requirements & Constraints
   - Architecture Components & Trade-offs
   - Privacy & Security Design
   - Cost Modeling & Optimization
   - Validation & Success Metrics

3. **Logical Design Flow Mapping:** Identify and structure these themes:

   - `The Prediction Problem` → **"1. Prediction API Objective & User Context"**
   - `Scaling Challenge` → **"2. Scaling Requirements & Viral Scenario"**
   - `Architecture Approach` → **"3. System Architecture & Components"**
   - `Privacy Concerns` → **"4. Privacy-by-Design & Guardrails"**
   - `Cost Discussion` → **"5. Cost Optimization & Free-Tier Strategy"**
   - `How We'll Validate` → **"6. Validation Plan & Success Metrics"**

4. **Integrate Project Templates:** Explicitly reference project resources:

   - Link to `Project_Spec_Template.md` sections
   - Reference `pia_template.md` for privacy documentation
   - Cite `cloud_toolkit.txt` for resource options
   - Use examples from `Project1_Ideas.md` for patterns

5. **Maintain Design-Focused Tone:** The output is a formal design plan focused on architecture decisions, not implementation details. Focus on "what" and "why", leaving "how" for later phases.

### **Step-by-Step Execution Process**

1. **Ingest and Analyze:** Read the entire `transcript_text` and review `context_files` to understand the prediction API's purpose and constraints.

2. **Extract Core Design Elements:**

   - **User & Decision:** Who uses predictions and for what decisions?
   - **Target & Horizon:** What is predicted and when?
   - **Scale Requirements:** Normal load vs. viral spike numbers
   - **Privacy Constraints:** k-anonymity, retention, access limits
   - **Cost Envelope:** Free-tier targets and surge budgets

3. **Structure Each Section:** Transform transcript content into formal sections:

   **Section 1: Prediction API Objective**

   - User personas and use cases
   - Decision context and value proposition
   - Target definition (binary/numeric/ETA)
   - Prediction horizon and update frequency

   **Section 2: Scaling Requirements**

   - Baseline traffic (e.g., 100 req/day)
   - Viral scenario (e.g., 50,000 req/hour)
   - Performance SLAs (p95 latency, availability)
   - Degradation strategies

   **Section 3: Architecture Design**

   - Component selection (serverless vs. containers)
   - Caching strategy (multi-tier)
   - Data flow and storage choices
   - Authentication and rate limiting

   **Section 4: Privacy & Security**

   - Data minimization principles
   - Anonymization techniques (k-anonymity, jittering)
   - Access controls and audit trails
   - Retention and deletion policies

   **Section 5: Cost Optimization**

   - Free-tier resource allocation
   - Cost projections (normal/surge/growth)
   - Trade-off analysis
   - Budget controls and alerts

   **Section 6: Validation Strategy**

   - Baseline vs. model comparison
   - Metrics selection (AUC-PR, MAE, etc.)
   - Load testing scenarios
   - Acceptance criteria

4. **Final Review and Refinement:** Ensure the document flows logically, preserves all design decisions, and aligns with project rubrics.

### **Example Usage**

```bash
/transcript-to-summary --transcript_text "@docs/transcripts/saferRoute_design_discussion.md" --context_files ["@docs/Project_Spec_Template.md", "@docs/pia_template.md"] --prediction_type "safety"
```

### **Final Deliverable**

Your output must be **only the content of the generated markdown document**. Do not include any conversational text. Your response is the final `Design_Plan_{API}.md` placed in `@docs/design_plans/`.

# Design Plan: SafeRoute Walking Safety Prediction API

## 1. Executive Summary & Project Context

SafeRoute is a scalable prediction API designed to enhance pedestrian safety by providing real-time risk assessments for 200-meter grid cells in urban areas. The system must handle viral traffic spikes (100 req/day → 50,000 req/hour) while maintaining strict privacy standards and operating within cloud free-tier constraints during normal operations.

**Core Challenge:** Design a system that balances public safety value with individual privacy, scales elastically during viral events, and remains economically sustainable.

**Key Stakeholders:**

- Primary Users: Pedestrians choosing safer walking routes
- Secondary Users: City operations teams planning infrastructure improvements
- Community Benefit: Reduced pedestrian incidents through informed decision-making

## 2. Prediction API Objective & User Context

### 2.1 User & Decision Framework

- **Who:** Urban pedestrians, particularly vulnerable populations (elderly, parents with children, night-shift workers)
- **Decision:** Route selection and timing choices for safer walking
- **Value Proposition:** Reduce walking-related incidents by 15-20% through predictive awareness

### 2.2 Prediction Target & Horizon

- **Target:** P(unsafe condition) for each 200m grid cell
- **Horizon:** Next 60 minutes, updated every 5 minutes
- **Output Range:** Risk score 0.0-1.0 with confidence intervals
- **Spatial Resolution:** 200m x 200m grid (balancing utility with privacy)

### 2.3 Feature Engineering (No Leakage)

Features available at prediction time:

- Grid cell identifier (hashed)
- Temporal features: hour, day of week, season
- Environmental: lighting index, weather conditions
- Infrastructure: sidewalk quality score, crosswalk density
- Historical: 30-day aggregated incident patterns (k≥10)
- Real-time proxies: traffic flow estimates, event schedules

**Explicitly Excluded (Leakage Prevention):**

- Future incident reports
- Individual-level tracking data
- Precise GPS coordinates

## 3. Scaling Requirements & Viral Scenario

### 3.1 Traffic Patterns

| Load Scenario  | Request Rate    | Duration    | Frequency |
| -------------- | --------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Normal         | 100 req/day     | Continuous  | Daily     |
| Growth         | 1,000 req/day   | 3 months    | Expected  |
| Viral Spike    | 50,000 req/hour | 3-6 hours   | 2-3x/year |
| Sustained High | 5,000 req/hour  | 24-48 hours | Monthly   |

### 3.2 Performance SLAs

- **Latency:** p95 < 100ms, p99 < 200ms
- **Availability:** 99.9% (allows 43 minutes downtime/month)
- **Throughput:** 15 requests/second sustained, 50 requests/second burst
- **Cache Hit Rate:** >80% for popular grid cells

### 3.3 Degradation Strategy

Priority levels during overload:

1. Serve cached predictions (5-minute TTL)
2. Reduce spatial resolution (400m grid)
3. Provide baseline safety scores only
4. Return HTTP 503 with retry-after header

## 4. System Architecture & Components

### 4.1 Architecture Decision: Serverless-First with Container Fallback

**Primary Choice: AWS Lambda**

- Rationale: Perfect for unpredictable traffic, zero cost when idle
- Trade-offs: Cold start latency vs. cost efficiency
- Mitigation: Provisioned concurrency for 10 baseline instances

**Alternative Evaluated: Fargate Containers**

- Considered for: Predictable base load after growth phase
- Threshold: Switch when sustained traffic >2,000 req/hour

### 4.2 Component Architecture
```

Client → CloudFront CDN → API Gateway → Lambda Functions → DynamoDB
↓ ↓
(Cache Layer) ElastiCache Redis
↓
S3 (Historical Data)

```

### 4.3 Caching Strategy (Multi-Tier)
1. **CloudFront CDN:** Static predictions, 5-minute TTL
2. **ElastiCache Redis:** Dynamic aggregations, 1-minute TTL
3. **Lambda Memory:** Frequently accessed grid cells, 30-second TTL
4. **DynamoDB:** Persistent cache with 1-hour TTL

### 4.4 Data Storage Design
- **Hot Data (DynamoDB):** Current predictions, 7-day retention
- **Warm Data (S3 Standard):** 30-day historical aggregates
- **Cold Data (S3 Glacier):** Anonymized yearly patterns

## 5. Privacy-by-Design & Security Guardrails

### 5.1 Privacy Principles (Following PIA Template)
- **Data Minimization:** Collect only grid-level aggregates
- **Purpose Limitation:** Safety predictions only, no surveillance
- **Transparency:** Public documentation of data use
- **User Control:** Opt-out mechanism for contribution

### 5.2 Technical Guardrails
- **k-Anonymity:** Suppress cells with k<10 unique users
- **Temporal Jittering:** ±5 minutes on all predictions
- **Spatial Aggregation:** No resolution below 200m
- **Differential Privacy:** ε=1.0 for public statistics

### 5.3 Access Control & Authentication
```

Public Tier: API Key, 60 req/min rate limit
Registered Apps: OAuth2, 600 req/min, enhanced data
Municipal Partners: IAM roles, full historical access

```

### 5.4 Telemetry & Audit (Privacy-Preserving)
Collected metrics (no PII):
- Request patterns (hashed IPs)
- Grid cell popularity (anonymous)
- Model performance (aggregate only)
- System health (latency, errors)

## 6. Cost Optimization & Free-Tier Strategy

### 6.1 Free-Tier Utilization (Normal Load)
| Service | Free Tier Limit | Usage at 100 req/day | Buffer |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|---------|

| API Gateway | 1M calls/month | 3,000 calls | 99.7% |
| DynamoDB | 25GB storage | 1GB | 96% |
| CloudFront | 50GB transfer | 100MB | 99.8% |

### 6.2 Cost Projections
- **Normal Operations:** $0/month (within free tier)
- **Growth Phase (1K req/day):** ~$5/month
- **Viral Event (3 hours):** ~$25-40
- **Monthly Budget Cap:** $100 (auto-scaling limits)

### 6.3 Cost Control Mechanisms
- CloudWatch billing alarms at $10, $50, $100
- Lambda concurrent execution limit: 100
- API Gateway throttling: 10,000 req/second
- Auto-shutdown if daily cost >$50

## 7. Validation Plan & Success Metrics

**Proposed Model:** Logistic regression with engineered features
**Comparison Metric:** AUC-PR (handles class imbalance)

### 7.2 Offline Evaluation Plan
1. Historical data split: 80% train, 20% test
2. Time-based validation (no future leakage)
3. Spatial cross-validation (hold-out neighborhoods)
4. Baseline: AUC-PR = 0.65, Target: AUC-PR > 0.75

### 7.3 Load Testing Scenarios
Using Apache JMeter or Gatling:
1. **Gradual Ramp:** 0 → 10,000 req/hour over 60 minutes
2. **Spike Test:** Instant jump to 50,000 req/hour
3. **Soak Test:** 5,000 req/hour for 24 hours
