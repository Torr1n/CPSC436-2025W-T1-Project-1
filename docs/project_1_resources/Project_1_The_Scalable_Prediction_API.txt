Project 1: The Scalable Prediction API
ðŸŒŸ At a Glance
Goal: Build a scalable prediction API that can survive a viral spike while staying in the free tier.

Context: Your startup went viral on TikTok. Traffic jumped from 100 req/day â†’ 50,000 req/hour.

Skills Practiced: Cost modeling, serverless vs. containers, scaling, authentication, AI collaboration.

Deliverables: Design doc, Implementation, AI Portfolio, Reflection.  Provide a link to your github in the class organization. Note that you need to share it with the class when you submit it.

ðŸ“¦ Deliverables
Design Document (3â€“5 pages) â€” architecture + constraints, ML rationale, cost analysis.

Implementation â€” repo with history, working deployment, monitoring + security.

AI Collaboration Portfolio â€” logs, evaluation of advice, prompt iterations, failures & corrections.

Reflection Report (2â€“3 pages) â€” lessons on trade-offs, constraints, AI collaboration.

âœ… Grading Focus
Survival: does it scale 10Ã— without crashing?

Economy: does it fit free tier under normal load?

Professionalism: are your decisions defendable?

AI Fluency: did you use AI as a collaborator, not a crutch?

Learning: do you show systems thinking beyond code?

Rubric
Criteria	Ratings	Pts
This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeScope (Designâ€‘only)
No code or running system required; prototypes are optional and not graded. Focus on framing, specification, privacy/ethics, tradeâ€‘offs, and evaluation plan.
0 pts
This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeInsight & Problem Framing
Clear user/decision; compelling, non-obvious insights guiding the design.
20 pts
This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeSpecification Clarity (target/horizon/features, API, metrics/SLA)
No leakage; API coherent; metrics/SLA well-justified.
20 pts
This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeBaseline & Evaluation Plan (incl. SLA/cost)
Strong baseline; minimal experiment; SLA/cost measurement plan.
15 pts
This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomePrivacy/Ethics/Reciprocity (PIA + telemetry + guardrails)
Specific PIA; telemetry matrix thoughtful; guardrails (k/jitter/retention/access) integrated; reciprocity concrete.
20 pts
This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeArchitecture & Feasibility (diagram, trade-offs)
Diagram fits constraints; explicit trade-offs and alternatives.
10 pts
This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeRisks & Mitigations + Measurement Plan
Top risks identified with concrete tests; clear acceptance criteria.
10 pts
This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeEvolution & Communication (git, memo, clarity)
Git shows evolution; insight memo, assumption audit, Socratic log referenced; clear, concise writing.
