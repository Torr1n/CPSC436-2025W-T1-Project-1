# Socratic Log (AI as Thinking Partner)

---

**Purpose**: make AI use accountable and generative. Log the moments that changed your mind—not the entire chat.

## What to capture (≤ 1 page per sprint)

- Prompt(s) that led to a design alternative you tested (quote briefly)
- A red-team prompt that argued the opposite of your current view
- The inflection point: what changed in your thinking and why
- What you tested as a result, and the outcome
- Attributions: which parts of text/code came from AI vs you (high level)

## What not to capture

- Full transcripts; sensitive data; secrets; private user content

## Example structure

- **Context**: (one sentence)
- **Prompt A (design alternatives)**: " ... " → Option you tested
- **Prompt B (red-team)**: " ... " → Risk you checked
- **Inflection point**: (2–3 sentences)
- **Evidence**: (link to code/figure)
- **Outcome**: (what changed, what you kept)

> The goal is to show that AI nudged your thinking and how you validated it—not to outsource the work.
